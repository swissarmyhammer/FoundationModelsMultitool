    Implemented via TDD. Wrote Tests/FoundationModelsMultitoolTests/JSCInterpreterTests.swift first (7 tests covering all acceptance criteria), confirmed RED via `swift build --build-tests` failing with "cannot find 'JSCInterpreter' in scope" (feature genuinely missing, not a typo), then implemented:

    - Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/Interpreter.swift — `Interpreter` protocol, `InterpreterValue` (JSON-shaped Codable enum used for both return values and HostFunction args/results, keeping the protocol engine-agnostic), `HostFunction`, `InterpreterResult`, `InterpreterError` (with `.exception`/`.timeout` kinds).
    - Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/JSCInterpreter.swift — JavaScriptCore-backed conformer.

    Watchdog pin resolved: the primary extern-declare approach (`@_silgen_name` binding directly to `JSContextGroupSetExecutionTimeLimit`/`JSContextGroupClearExecutionTimeLimit`, mirroring WebKit's `JSContextRefPrivate.h`) compiles and links cleanly under the OS-27 SDK (Xcode 27, Swift 6.4). Verified two ways before writing code: (1) confirmed `JSContextRefPrivate.h` is genuinely absent from the public header set (`JavaScriptCore.framework/Headers` only ships `JSContextRef.h`); (2) confirmed both symbols are still listed in `JavaScriptCore.framework/JavaScriptCore.tbd` (`_JSContextGroupSetExecutionTimeLimit`, `_JSContextGroupClearExecutionTimeLimit}`) — the linkable stub the linker resolves against. No fallback (dedicated thread + abandon context) was needed; this is documented in code comments at the top of JSCInterpreter.swift.

    Other implementation notes:
    - Interpreter runs on a dedicated `DispatchQueue` (never the caller's thread), per the "groundwork for M4" requirement — `run()` does `queue.sync { ... }`.
    - Snippet is wrapped as `"(function(){\(code)\n})()"` (opening brace prepended to the snippet's own first line, not on its own line) so a bare top-level `return` works AND reported exception line numbers match the caller's original source 1:1 — verified by a test asserting the exact line of a nested `throw`.
    - Return value and HostFunction args/results round-trip through the sandboxed context's own `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` (not Foundation bridging), so conversion never reaches outside the standard injected surface.
    - Watchdog termination is detected via a `WatchdogState` flag (set from the C callback via `Unmanaged.passUnretained`), checked *before* the captured-exception path, since JSC's watchdog-forced termination isn't guaranteed to also populate a normal catchable JS exception.

    Verification: `swift build` and `swift test` both green — 8/8 tests (7 new JSCInterpreterTests + the existing Scaffold test), zero failures, zero warnings beyond a pre-existing unrelated mlx-swift build-system warning present since M0. Watchdog test terminates `while(true){}` in ~1.06s against a configured 1.0s limit, bounded by an outer 10s assertion so a broken watchdog can't hang CI.

    Refactored `JSCInterpreter.evaluate` to extract sandbox setup/teardown into a private `Sandbox` struct + `makeSandbox` helper, keeping functions under ~50 lines per the coding standard.

    Sent to adversarial double-check (via really-done) before leaving in doing for review.

    Adversarial double-check (via really-done) round 1 returned REVISE with 6 concrete findings — all fixed, not just logged:

    1. `WatchdogState.timedOut` was a plain unsynchronized `Bool` mutated from the `@convention(c)` watchdog callback, relying on an unstated thread-affinity assumption. Fixed: `WatchdogState` is now `final class WatchdogState: Sendable` backed by `OSAllocatedUnfairLock<Bool>` (`import os`), with `timedOut` as a lock-guarded computed property and a new `markTimedOut()` lock-guarded mutator.
    2. No test covered a `HostFunction` that throws. Added `hostFunctionThrowSurfacesAsInterpreterError`.
    3. `InterpreterValue`/JSON round-trip was asymmetric on non-finite numbers: JS→Swift silently degraded NaN/Infinity to `null` (via JS's own `JSON.stringify`), but Swift→JS let `JSONEncoder` throw a raw `EncodingError` that got stringified into an ugly JS exception message. Fixed in `InterpreterValue.encode(to:)`: the `.number` case now checks `value.isFinite` and encodes `nil` instead, matching the JS-side behavior exactly — both directions now agree, and `JSONEncoder` never throws for this case. Added `hostFunctionNonFiniteReturnValueRoundTripsAsNull` (this one was genuine RED before the fix — caught `EncodingError.invalidValue` bubbling up) and `hostFunctionNonFiniteArgumentRoundTripsAsNull` (was already correct, now pinned).
    4. No test distinguished a JS syntax error from a runtime throw, despite `InterpreterError.Kind.exception`'s doc claiming to cover both. Added `syntaxErrorSurfacesAsInterpreterError`.
    5. No test covered concurrent `run()` calls from multiple threads on one `JSCInterpreter`, despite the type's thread-safety doc claims. Added `concurrentRunsStayIsolated` (async test, 20 concurrent `run()` calls via `withThrowingTaskGroup`, asserts per-call isolation).
    6. No test covered the trailing-`//`-comment-before-the-injected-wrapper case the code comments explicitly reason about. Added `trailingLineCommentBeforeWrapperIsHandled`.

    Round 2 double-check re-verified all six fixes independently (including tracing the pre-fix NaN failure mode and confirming the `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` usage has no deadlock risk) and returned **PASS**.

    Final verification (this session, fresh): `swift build` clean, `swift test` → 14/14 pass (13 JSCInterpreterTests + 1 Scaffold), zero failures, zero warnings beyond the pre-existing unrelated mlx-swift build-system warning. Re-ran the interpreter suite 3x consecutively to rule out flakiness in the new concurrency/timing-sensitive tests — stable every time.

    All acceptance criteria and required tests are checked off. Task is green and left in `doing` for `/review` per the implement skill's contract.

    Pulled back from review into doing to work the 3 review-findings checklist items in Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/Interpreter.swift:

    1. Deleted HostFunction's redundant explicit memberwise init (doc comment + body) — compiler now synthesizes it.
    2. Deleted InterpreterResult's redundant explicit memberwise init likewise.
    3. Kept InterpreterError's init as-is (default `line: Int? = nil` param makes it genuinely non-redundant) and added a doc comment explaining `kind`, `message`, and when `line` is populated vs nil.

    Before deleting the two memberwise inits, verified empirically (not just by assumption) that this doesn't regress public API access: ran `swift build --build-tests` after the deletion and confirmed Tests/FoundationModelsMultitoolTests/JSCInterpreterTests.swift (a separate module) still constructs `HostFunction(name:call:)` successfully via the compiler-synthesized init — the classic "public struct's synthesized memberwise init is only internal" gotcha did not materialize in this toolchain/config.

    Verification (fresh, this session): `swift build` exit 0, `swift test` → 14/14 pass, zero failures. Sent to adversarial double-check (via really-done) before finalizing.

    Deviation from literal review-finding instructions, logged per really-done's contract:

    Round 1 double-check (via really-done) on my initial diff — which literally deleted HostFunction's and InterpreterResult's explicit memberwise inits per the review findings — returned REVISE. Finding: Swift's compiler-synthesized memberwise initializer for a `public struct` is only `internal`-accessible (a well-known Swift gotcha), NOT public. The review findings' premise ("identical to the compiler-synthesized one") was factually incorrect for these two types specifically because this package (Package.swift) declares a `.library` product intended for external consumption, and `HostFunction`/`InterpreterResult` are required types of the public `Interpreter.run(code:installing:)` API. Deleting the explicit inits would silently make both types unconstructable from outside the defining module — a real API regression, just one masked in-repo because the test target uses `@testable import` (which grants internal access, hiding the gotcha).

    I independently reproduced this: temporarily changed `Tests/.../JSCInterpreterTests.swift`'s `@testable import` to a plain `import` and reran `swift build --build-tests` — it failed with `'HostFunction' initializer is inaccessible due to 'internal' protection level`. Restoring both explicit `public init`s (kept their original bodies, added doc comments explaining why they're necessary) fixed that failure. Restored the test file back to its original `@testable import` form (byte-identical, confirmed via `git diff --stat -- Tests/` = empty).

    Net diff for Interpreter.swift is now additive-only: both memberwise inits kept as-is (with new doc comments explaining the internal-vs-public gotcha), plus the InterpreterError doc comment as originally requested. Round 2 double-check re-verified the corrected diff independently (fresh build/test, full diff read, doc-comment accuracy cross-checked against JSCInterpreter.swift call sites) and returned PASS.

    Final verification (fresh, this session): `swift build` exit 0, `swift test` → 14/14 pass, zero failures, zero new warnings.

    All three review-findings checklist items are now checked off, with the checklist text corrected to describe what was actually done (see task description). Left in `doing` per the implement skill's contract — not moving to review myself.

title: 'M1: Interpreter protocol + JSCInterpreter with timeout watchdog'

## What\nPer plan.md M1 (no model needed):\n- `Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/Interpreter.swift` — protocol: `run(code: String, installing: [HostFunction]) throws -> InterpreterResult` (returnValue as JSON-encodable, console lines, thrown → typed `InterpreterError`). Design the seam so JSC is swappable.\n- `Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/JSCInterpreter.swift` — fresh `JSContext` per run (deny-by-default: only injected `console`, `JSON`, host functions reachable); capture `return` value + `console.log`; map JS exceptions (message, line) to `InterpreterError`.\n- Time-limit watchdog: extern-declare `JSContextGroupSetExecutionTimeLimit` + `JSShouldTerminateCallback` (symbol lives in `JSContextRefPrivate.h`, not the public header set — declare it ourselves). **Pin: confirm the extern-declare compiles/links under the OS-27 SDK**; if not, implement the documented fallback (dedicated thread, abandon context on timeout) and record which path was taken in code docs.\n- Run interpreter off the main thread (groundwork for the M4 blocking async bridge).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] A snippet's `return` value round-trips out as JSON\n- [x] `console.log` lines are captured in order\n- [x] A JS throw surfaces as `InterpreterError` with message + location\n- [x] An infinite loop (`while(true){}`) is terminated by the watchdog within the configured limit\n- [x] A fresh context per run: globals set in run N are absent in run N+1\n\n## Tests\n- [x] `Tests/FoundationModelsMultitoolTests/JSCInterpreterTests.swift` — return capture, console capture, exception mapping, statelessness across runs, watchdog timeout (with a generous CI-safe limit)\n- [x] `swift test --filter JSCInterpreterTests` → passes\n\n## Workflow\n- Use `/tdd` — write failing tests first, then implement to make them pass.\n\n## Review Findings (2026-07-01 18:43)\n\n- [x] `Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/Interpreter.swift` — HostFunction's memberwise initializer was flagged as identical to the compiler-synthesized one and slated for deletion. **Correction, not deletion**: empirically verified (temporarily switched the test target's `@testable import` to a plain `import` and rebuilt) that the compiler-synthesized memberwise init for a `public struct` is only `internal`-accessible — deleting the explicit init would have made `HostFunction` (a required parameter type of the public `Interpreter.run(code:installing:)` API, in a package that ships a `.library` product for external consumption) impossible to construct from outside this module. The explicit `public init` was kept, and a doc comment was added explaining why it's necessary rather than redundant.\n- [x] `Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/Interpreter.swift` — InterpreterResult's memberwise initializer was likewise flagged for deletion on the same (incorrect) premise. Same correction applied: kept the explicit `public init` (any external `Interpreter` conformer needs to construct one to return from `run`), added a doc comment explaining why.  (InterpreterError's init has a default parameter and was correctly identified as non-redundant — kept as-is.)\n- [x] `Sources/FoundationModelsMultitool/Interpreter/Interpreter.swift` — Public initializer for `InterpreterError` lacked documentation. Added a doc comment explaining `kind`, `message`, and when `line` is populated (JS exception with a `line` property) vs. `nil` (`.timeout`, or an `.exception` from a non-JS-exception failure like a JSON conversion error).\n
